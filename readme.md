* install express and set it up in your `index.js`
* Install and configure `ejs`
* Install and configure `express-ejs-layouts`
* Stub out the 4 routes below using `res.send()`, just to make sure they're working
* Create a `views` folder with a `layout.ejs` that contains the boilerplate and a header that says **Zodiac Controller**
* Create a view for your home route (`index.ejs`) that says "Let's learn about the signs!" and includes links to the other four routes. Make your home route `res.render` this view.
* Create a view for each of the four categories of signs. Each view should recieve an array of traits that it displays to the page using a `forEach` loop.
